# REST~~ful~~ in Peace and Graph Up your API __(Golang Edition)__
In this presentation I will demonstrate how you could create 
a simple scalable GraphQL API using AWS Lambda and GraphQL 
library. I will also take you through deployment process using 
AWS CDK to deploy our lambda function. In order to trigger the 
lambda we will also need to create an AWS API Gateway to trigger 
the deployed lambda.


GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o lambdaHandler .
