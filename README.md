# REST~~ful~~ in Peace and Graph Up your API
In this presentation I will demonstrate how you could create a simple scalable GraphQL API 
using AWS Lambda and GraphQL library. I will also take you through deployment process using 
AWS CDK to deploy our lambda function. In order to trigger the lambda we will also need to 
create an AWS API Gateway to trigger the deployed lambda.
